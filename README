# Raytracer Project

## How to find what you are looking for in the commits

You can use the progress_screenshots folder to find any meaningful milestone and move between these commits.
I am otherwise loosely commiting a lot of stuff at once which might be hard to follow (and therefore my commit messages don't mean much...)

## How to compile

You can use the "basic" vscode setup to compile C++ using the tasks.json file

## How to view output

Until refactored, the output uses the ppm fileformat which is unfortunately pretty much unreadable on Windows 11
However you can go to [this site](https://www.cs.rhodes.edu/welshc/COMP141_F16/ppmReader.html) to load your ppm in the browser and view the file
(I guess you could also create your own visualizer or find one on github since ppm is such a simple format)

I'll probably try to output to png or jpeg as an exercise once this project's done (although might be a little complex from what I know about both formats)
